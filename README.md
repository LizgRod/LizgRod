Hi, Welcome to my GitHub page!

I graduated from The University of Colorado, Boulder in May 2023 with a bachelor's of Statistics and Data Science.
Some of my relevant skills include but are not limited to
* Python
* R
* Matlab
* Stata
* SQL
* Excel
* Time-Series Analysis
* Applied Regression Analysis
* Markov Processes
* Random Graphs
* Operation Research
* Mathematical Modeling

On my page, you can find some samples of projects, codes, and papers I have written/worked on. Due to sensitive information, much of the code may not run or work. Some of the topics I cover are ARMA/ARIMA processes, regression, and Bayes theorem.
